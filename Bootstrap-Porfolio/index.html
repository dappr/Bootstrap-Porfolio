            After reading numerous reports about the major lack of diversity in the technology sector I made the decision to be apart of the solution and learn how to code . While there are many great programs and initiatives out there that provide this service for free, many in the black community are either unaware or uninterested. As I complete my MBA, I plan to merge my knowledge of business  and computer science to not only become a successful entrepreneur, but to bridge the gap between technology education and those in my community. 
            Technology is the future and of course it will never stop and only continue to advance by the day. Being aware of this allows one to create a better future for him or herself as many in other cultures have.  As I mentioned before, a few things have changed but the main goals stay the same, completing this course brings me another step closer to my ultimate goal of showing our youth that there are more ways than one or two to be a success.
